# roadmap for job

## 1. **Core Computer Science Skills (Never Go Out of Style)**

- **Data Structures & Algorithms** → for problem-solving and interviews.
- **Databases (SQL + NoSQL)** → every system needs data handling.
- **Operating Systems & Networking basics** → how systems actually work.
- **System Design** → scalability, distributed systems, APIs.

👉 These are like “oxygen” — even if AI hype shifts, companies always need them.

---

## 2. **AI / ML Fundamentals (Ride the Wave, Not Just the Hype)**

- **Python + ML libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, PyTorch/TensorFlow).**
- **Math for ML** → linear algebra, probability, optimization.
- **LLMs & GenAI basics** → fine-tuning, prompting, vector databases, RAG.
- **GPU basics** → CUDA concepts, training/inference efficiency.

👉 Learn enough to *apply AI*, not just talk hype.

## 3. **Software Engineering for AI**

- Building **end-to-end systems**: data pipeline → model → API → frontend.
- **MLOps / DevOps for AI**: deployment, monitoring, scaling models.
- **Cloud skills** (AWS, Azure, GCP) → many AI workloads run there.

---

## 4. **Survivor Skills (Like Engineers after Dot-Com Crash)**

- **Adaptability** → be ready to work in fintech, healthcare, enterprise, robotics, not just startups.
- **Product Thinking** → don’t just code models; understand if it *adds business value*.
- **Cost Awareness** → in AI, GPU cost = survival. Knowing how to optimize costs makes you valuable.

---

## 5. **Bonus (Future-Proof Bets)**

- **AI + Domain knowledge** → AI in healthcare, finance, education, manufacturing = stronger than generic chatbots.
- **Security & Privacy** → as AI scales, securing data is a big deal.
- **Ethics / Regulation awareness** → governments are stepping in (like GDPR for data).

---

⚡ **So your roadmap**:

1. Master **CS fundamentals** (DSA, DBMS, OS, Networking, System Design).
2. Learn **AI/ML applied skills** (Python ML stack, LLM basics, MLOps).
3. Get comfortable with **cloud + deployment**.
4. Keep an eye on **domain-specific AI applications** → that’s where lasting jobs will be.
