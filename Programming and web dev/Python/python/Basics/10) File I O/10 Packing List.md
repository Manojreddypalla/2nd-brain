# 10. Packing List

## [**#](https://www.codedex.io/intermediate-python/10-packing-list#congrats)Â Congrats!**

**Nice work on getting to the end of the chapter! ðŸ”¥**

**Letâ€™s recap what we learned:**

- **File handling in Python, including how to read and write files.**
- **Using the theÂ `.read()`Â ,Â `.write()`, andÂ `.seek()`Â methods to interact with file contents.**
- **Working with CSV file data using theÂ `csv`Â module.**

**As a refresher, here is what file handling in Python looks like:**

```python
with open('filename.txt', 'r') as file:
  try:
    # Work with files here
  except Error:
    # Catch errors here

```

## **Instructions**

**Moving day is almost here! As you gather your belongings, the thought of packing everything can feel overwhelming. ðŸ˜¥**

**Using what we learned about files in Python, letâ€™s make a program to help manage your packing list.**

**First, in aÂ .pyÂ file, import theÂ `csv`Â module. Then, paste the following:**

```python
data = [
  ['Item', 'Quantity'],
  ['Blender', 2],
  ['Posters', 30],
  ['Shoes', 2]
]

```

**We're gonna use thisÂ `data`Â to make a CSV file!**

**Next, create aÂ `try`-`except`Â statement. For theÂ `try`Â block:**

- **Try opening aÂ `packing_list.csv`Â file inÂ `'r'`Â "read" mode.**
- **Create a reader object for the CSV file.**
- **Loop through andÂ `print()`Â each row in the object .**

**For theÂ `except`Â block:**

- **Specify theÂ `FileNotFoundError`.**
- **Print "Packing list file not found. Creating a new one."**
- **Open a newÂ `packing_list.csv`Â file inÂ `'w'`Â "write" mode.**
- **Create a writer object of the CSV file.**
- **Use the object'sÂ `.writerows()`Â method to process theÂ `data`Â variable.**

**At this point, go ahead and save yourÂ .pyÂ file and run your program once.**

**Look in your file system and you should see a new CSV file in the same folder as this file.**

**Nice, you did it! Go ahead and add more things to your packing list and share with your friends to have them double check!**

**Happy packing! ðŸ“¦**
