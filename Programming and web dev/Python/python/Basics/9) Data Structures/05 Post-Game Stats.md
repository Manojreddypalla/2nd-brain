# 05. Post-Game Stats

# [**#](https://www.codedex.io/intermediate-python/05-post-game-stats#congrats) Congrats!**

**Nice job on finishing the first chapter! 🚀**

**In this chapter, we learned the following:**

- **`int`, `float`, `str`, and `bool` types.**
- **Tuples are ordered, immutable sequences.**
- **Dictionaries are unordered sequences of key-value pairs.**
- **Sets are unordered lists of unique items.**

**For a refresher, here are what these data structures look like:**

```python
# Tuple
teams = ('TeamA', 'TeamB')

# Dictionary
basketball_player = {'name': 'LeBron James', 'team': 'Los Angeles Lakers'}

# Set
soccer_positions = {'Forward', 'Midfielder', 'Defender', 'Goalkeeper'}

```

**Let's put it together one more time!**

## **Instructions**

**Imagine you have a dataset 📊 with information about your favorite sports team. 🏀🎾⚽ The goal is to use Python's data structures to organize and analyze this data.**

**If you can't think of any, feel free to use the 🏈 Super Bowl 2024 champions, the Kansas City Chiefs. 🏆**

**As a data analyst for the Kansas City Chiefs you have been given a dataset containing information about the players, their positions, and some game statistics.**

**Let's start analyzing!**

- **Create a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a player. Include attributes such as 'name,' 'position,' and 'jersey number.'**
- **Print out a list of all player positions in the dataset.**
- **Choose a player and update their game statistics in the dataset.**
- **Calculate the average statistics (e.g., yards gained, touchdowns) for all players and print the results.**

**Congratulations for reaching the end of this chapter! Using data structures, you were able to organize and analyze data for the Chiefs. 😎 Think of all the things you can analyze!**

**✨ Just remember practice makes perfect. ✨**

**In the next chapter, we'll explore file input/output in Python. Hope you can handle it! 👀**
