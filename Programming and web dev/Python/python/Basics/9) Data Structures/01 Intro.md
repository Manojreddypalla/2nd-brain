**Welcome back! Guess who’s back? Back again? It's Python! 🐍**

**It's time to take things to another level with Python, it's finally time to add data structures to your toolkit.**

**From creating whimsical Nyan Cat GIFs 🌈 to powering machine learning algorithms 🤖 , Python's extensive libraries and data structures make it a powerful language for data handling and data collection. Get ready to unleash your creativity!**

**Understanding data types is critical to organize and manipulate information in Python.**

**Let's go over our fundamental data types:**

- **🔢 `int`: Whole numbers like 0, 1, -4, 200.**
- **🎈 `float`: Decimals numbers like 3.14, 0.0, 12.99.**
- **🧵 `str`: Sequences of characters, enclosed in quotes like "howdy!"**
- **✅ `bool`: Boolean representations of a `True` or `False` value.**

**Data structures are containers that let us organize and store data effectively.**

**Remember Python lists? Those were data structures! A `list` stores different types of items in order, simplifying data organization and manipulation.**

```python
social_platforms = ['TikTok', 'Instagram', 'BeReal']

```

**In this chapter, we will focus on three new data structures:**

- **Tuples**
- **Dictionaries**
- **Sets**

**Each data structure comes with their own strengths and choosing the "right" one can significantly improve your program. 💪**

**Let's learn how each of them work and when to use them!**

## **Instructions**

**First, a quick refresh on lists. 📋**

**In a world where social media usage makes up 2+ hours of our day on average, it's hard to keep up with slang. Let's build a list of your favorite trendy or overused expressions! 😎**

**For example:**

```python
genz_slang = ['bestie', 'tea', 'cap', 'sus']

```

**Then, go ahead and print out your list!**

**Hit "Complete" and let’s dive into tuples, bestie! 💖**
