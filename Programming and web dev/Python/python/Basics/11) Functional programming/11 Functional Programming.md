# 11. Functional Programming

**Welcome to the third chapter!**

**At this phase of your Python journey, we delve into the wonderful world of functional programming! Though this may be a little redundant, functional programming shows us that structuring code with functions offers a different approach when problem solving.ðŸ’¡**

## [**#](https://www.codedex.io/intermediate-python/11-full-circle#pure-functions)Â Pure Functions**

**AÂ pure functionÂ is a function whose output derives solely from its input values, without side effects. They always return the same result, making them reliable and testable.**

**Global variables are defined outside of a function, making them easy to find and change values. Pure functions do not use or refrence global variables. You can always count on pure functions to act the same.**

**Here is an example of anÂ *impure*Â function vs. aÂ *pure*Â function:**

```python
def impure_squared(number):
  result = number ** 2
  print('The square of', number, 'is', result)
  return result

def pure_squared(number):
  return number ** 2

```

**Pay attention to the syntax:**

- **The pure function only returns the squared value ofÂ `number`.**
- **The impure function prints something to the terminal (the side effect).**

## **Instructions**

**Now that you can tell the difference between pure and impure functions, letâ€™s try it out.**

**Create a pure function to calculate the area of a circle given its radius.**

1. **Define aÂ `calculate_circle_area()`Â function that takes the radius of the circle as input.**
2. **Compute the area of the circle using the formula:Â *area*=*Ï€*âˆ—*r*2.**
3. **Return the result.**
