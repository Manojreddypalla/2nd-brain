# Arange

## [**#](https://www.codedex.io/numpy/10-halleys-comet#arange) .arange()**

**In Python, we have the built-in `.range()` function that we use in a `for` loop. Well, NumPy has something that looks similar called the `.arange()` function.**

**The `.arange()` function, short for “array range”, is a function that creates an array with evenly spaced values.**

**For example:**

```python
arr = np.arange(5)

print(arr)    # Output: [0 1 2 3 4]

```

**You can go further with its three parameters:**

- **`start` is the first value in the array.**
- **`stop` is end of the range.**
- **`step` is step size of the intervals.**

**For example:**

```python
arr = np.arange(start=1, stop=10, step=3)

print(arr)   # Output: [1 4 7]

```

- **We start with the value 1.**
- **We stop at the value 10.**
- **We go up 3 each time.**

**Now you might be thinking... why isn't 10 included? 🤔 The reason is that the `stop` value is always an upper limit that's not part of the range.**
