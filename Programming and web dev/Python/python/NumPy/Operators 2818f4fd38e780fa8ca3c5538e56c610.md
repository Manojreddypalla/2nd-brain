# Operators

**Arithmetic operations on arrays work on *all* the elements. A new array is created during the process.**

**Here are the basic operators:**

- **`+` Addition**
- **Subtraction**
- **Multiplication**
- **`/` Division**
- **`%` Modulo (returns the remainder)**

**Suppose we have an array of food order prices and there’s a 20% discount. And we want to update every element with the discount:**

```python
import numpy as np

order = np.array([12.99, 9.99, 4.99, 12.99])

print(order * 0.8)   # Output: [10.39 7.99 3.99 10.39]

```

**This is wayyy easier than if you do it with a Python list (where you have to use a `for` loop to update all the items in a list).**

**Let’s test out some basic operations first.**

## **Instructions**

**The world’s tallest buildings are the following:**

```python
tallest_buildings = np.array([2717, 2227, 2073, 1972, 1966, 1819, 1776])

```

**Oh wait, all the heights are using feet. Can you convert this array to meters?**

*m*=*ft*∗0.3048

**Use basic operations to create a new array with all the measurements in meters.**
