# 2D Arrays

## **So far in this course, weâ€™ve been only working with 1D (1-dimensional) arrays:**

```python
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])

```

**2D arraysÂ have 1D arrays as elements, meaning arrays within an array.**

**For example:**

```python
arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

```

**We can also write the same 2D array in a grid format (easier for the eyes):**

```python
arr = np.array([
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
])

```

- **The element at index 0 isÂ `[1, 2, 3]`.**
- **The element at index 1 isÂ `[4, 5, 6]`.**
- **The element at index 2 isÂ `[7, 8, 9]`.**

**To output each of the elements:**

```python
print(arr[0])     # Output: [1, 2, 3]
print(arr[1])     # Output: [4, 5, 6]
print(arr[2])     # Output: [7, 8, 9]

```

**We can also be more specific withÂ `arr[row][column]`. For example:**

```python
print(arr[0][0])  # Output: 1
print(arr[0][2])  # Output: 3
print(arr[2][2])  # Output: 9

```

**2D arrays appear more often than you think in real-world datasets.**

**For example, a seating plan for a room:**

```python
seating_plan = np.array([
  [0, 1, 3],
  [2, 9, 5],
  [6, 7, 10]
])

```

**A monthly budget (organized by month and category):**

```python
monthly_budget = np.array([
  [453.88, 192.44, 1750.00, 980.41, 578.22],   # month 1
  [689.77, 256.81, 1750.00, 865.34, 356.84],   # month 2
  [589.23, 293.42, 1850.00, 873.45, 789.23]    # month 3
])

```

**A grade book where rows correspond to individual students and columns to scores:**

```python
gradebook = np.array([
  [98, 98, 90, 84, 93, 73, 80],                # student 1
  [93, 95, 75, 90, 89, 84, 76],                # student 2
  [90, 89, 88, 84, 90, 67, 72],                # student 3
  [89, 84, 69, 74, 84, 70, 72]                 # student 4
])

```

**Enough examples! Let's try one out ourselves.**

## **Instructions**

![egg carton](https://i.imgur.com/r3x8Lcl.png)

**We've all been taught to check for cracked eggs before purchasing in grocery stores. But did you know that the probability of getting a rotten egg from a lot of 400 eggs is 3.5%?**

**Suppose we have a factory machine that determines the freshness of an egg (based on the expiration date, cracks in the shell, and smell) then assigns a number:**

- **âœ¨ 100% is a healthy fresh egg.**
- **ðŸ¤® 0% is completely rotten!**

```python
egg_carton1 = np.array([
  [0.89, 0.90, 0.83, 0.89, 0.97, 0.98],
  [0.95, 0.95, 0.89, 0.95, 0.23, 0.99]
])

egg_carton2 = np.array([
  [0.89, 0.95, 0.84, 0.92, 0.94, 0.93],
  [0.93, 0.95, 0.02, 0.03, 0.23, 0.99]
])

egg_carton3 = np.array([
  [0.83, 0.95, 0.89, 0.54, 0.37, 0.92],
  [0.98, 0.99, 0.19, 0.23, 0.89, 0.91]
])
