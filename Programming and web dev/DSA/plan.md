## **Step 1 (Weeks 1â€“2): Programming Foundations**

**Goal:** Build comfort with coding and problem-solving basics.

- **Topics**
    - Variables & Data Types (int, string, arrays, objects)
    - Control Structures: if-else, loops (for, while), functions
    - Basics of OOP: classes, objects, inheritance
    - Input/Output: console, simple file handling
- **Practice**: Solve 20â€“30 easy problems (basic math, strings, arrays).

---

## **Step 2 (Weeks 3â€“4): Basic Data Structures**

**Goal:** Learn core structures and their operations.

- Arrays: insert, delete, traverse
- Lists (singly & doubly linked list)
- Stack: push, pop, peek (using array & list)

- Queue: enqueue, dequeue, circular queue

- Hash Table: basics of hashing, collisions, maps
- **Practice**: 30â€“40 problems (array/list/stack/queue-based).

---

## **Step 3 (Weeks 5â€“6): Time & Space Complexity**

**Goal:** Analyze performance of code.

- Big-O basics (O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(nÂ²))
- Case analysis: best, worst, average
- Space vs. Time trade-offs
- **Practice**: Compare complexity of operations for arrays vs linked lists, stack vs queue, etc.

---

## **Step 4 (Weeks 7â€“8): Basic Algorithms**

**Goal:** Learn and implement classical algorithms.

- **Sorting**: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick
- **Searching**: Linear, Binary
- **Recursion**: factorial, Fibonacci, string/array recursion
- **Traversals**: arrays, strings, linked lists
- **Practice**: 30â€“40 problems (sorting + searching variations, recursion puzzles).

---

## **Step 5 (Weeks 9â€“12): Core DSA (Trees, Heaps, Graphs, Tries)**

**Goal:** Foundation for real-world systems + interview prep.

### Trees

- Tree traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder)
- Height/Depth, Diameter
- Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)
- Binary Search Tree (insert, search, delete, validate BST, kth smallest/largest)

### Heaps & Priority Queues

- Heapify
- Heap Sort
- Applications (top-k, priority scheduling)

### Graphs

- Representation: adjacency list/matrix
- BFS, DFS
- Detect cycle in graph
- Shortest path (Dijkstra, BFS for unweighted)
- Minimum spanning tree (Primâ€™s/Kruskalâ€™s)

### Tries

- Insert/Search word
- Word suggestions/autocomplete
- **Practice**: 50â€“60 problems across trees, heaps, graphs, and tries.

---

## **Step 6 (Weeks 13â€“16): Problem Solving Techniques**

**Goal:** Build intuition for patterns.

- **Two Pointers** (sorted arrays, pair-sum, remove duplicates)
- **Sliding Window** (longest substring, subarray problems)
- **Greedy Algorithms** (interval scheduling, activity selection, Huffman coding)
- **Backtracking** (N-Queens, Sudoku solver, permutations)
- **Dynamic Programming (DP)** (Fibonacci, knapsack, LIS, matrix DP)
- **Practice**: 70â€“80 mixed problems (these cover most interview questions).

---

## **Step 7 (Weeks 17â€“20): Advanced DSA for Top MNCs**

**Goal:** Handle toughest interview rounds.

### Advanced Graphs

- Topological Sort
- Strongly Connected Components (Kosaraju, Tarjan)
- Union-Find / Disjoint Set
- Advanced shortest paths (Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall)

### Advanced Patterns

- Binary Search on Answer (aggressive cows, painters partition)
- Bit Manipulation tricks (subsets, XOR, fast power)
- Mathematical Number Theory (GCD, modular exponentiation, primes sieve)
- Advanced Heap / Priority Queue problems (sliding window max, median of stream)
- Advanced Recursion & Divide & Conquer (matrix exponentiation, segment trees, divide & conquer optimizations)
- **Practice**: 80â€“100 problems (focus on LeetCode Medium/Hard).

# ðŸ“Œ Extra Recommendations

- **Daily Routine**:
    - 1 hr theory + implementation
    - 1â€“2 hrs problem solving
- **Platforms**: LeetCode, Codeforces (for contests), GeeksforGeeks (for revision)
- **Revision Strategy**: Every 2 weeks, revisit tricky problems.
- **Project Tie-in**: Build small systems (e.g., text autocomplete using tries, shortest path visualizer, scheduler using heaps).
