# Environmental Setup

## Accessing the Bash Shell

*   **Linux:** Open Terminal (`Alt+Ctrl+T`).
*   **macOS:** Open Terminal from Launchpad. You may need to switch from the default Z Shell to Bash using `exec bash`. To make Bash your default shell, use `chsh -s /bin/bash`.
*   **Windows:**
    *   **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL):** The recommended method. Allows you to run a Linux distribution within Windows.
    *   **Cygwin:** An alternative that emulates a Linux environment on Windows.

## Installing a Text Editor

You will need a text editor to write your Bash scripts.

*   **Terminal-based editors:**
    *   `vi` or `vim`
    *   `nano`
*   **Graphical User Interface (GUI) editors:**
    *   Sublime Text
    *   Visual Studio Code
    *   Atom

It is recommended to use an editor with syntax highlighting for Bash to improve readability.
