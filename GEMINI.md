# Directory Overview

This directory is a personal knowledge base, also known as a "Second Brain," managed using the Obsidian note-taking application. It contains a collection of notes and documents on various topics, primarily focused on technology, software development, and job preparation. The notes are written in Markdown and interlinked to create a web of knowledge.

## Key Areas

The repository is organized into the following main topics:

*   **AI:** Notes related to Artificial Intelligence, including sub-topics like `Lang Chain`, `Ollama`, and `RAG`.
*   **BOOKS:** Contains notes and summaries of books, such as "Black Hat Bash".
*   **JOB:** A collection of materials for job preparation, including a plan, resume, and notes on various AI topics relevant to job applications.

*   **The Hackerâ€™s Log Pose:** A collection of notes on various technical skills, including databases, DevOps, Git, Linux, and Tailscale.

## Usage

This directory is intended to be used as a personal knowledge base within the Obsidian application. The notes are meant to be browsed and searched. The interlinked nature of the notes allows for easy navigation between related topics. The `GEMINI.md` file itself provides a high-level overview of the content and structure of the knowledge base for future interactions with the Gemini CLI.
