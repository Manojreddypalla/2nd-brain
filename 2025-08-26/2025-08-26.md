## Experiments
- Conducted a small experiment in my **homelab**.  
- For more details on the homelab setup and tools, refer to the main [README](../README.md).

## Learnings & Improvements
- Enhanced my understanding of **remote access** using **SSH**.  
- Explored how to configure and use SSH with **Git** for secure authentication.  

## Tools Explored
- **Kasm Workspaces**:  
  A powerful browser-based lab environment built on Docker containers. It enables secure streaming of full workspaces (e.g., Kali Linux, Ubuntu, browsers) directly to the browser.  
  - Removes the need to carry my full setup.  
  - Provides a flexible way to experiment and learn.  

- **Tailscale + SSH**:  
  Using **Tailscale** for secure networking and **SSH** for remote system access. This combination creates a robust and portable way to connect to my systems from anywhere.  

## Reflections
Kasm feels like a game-changer â€” essentially a **cloud-like hacking and learning lab** accessible via the browser. Coupled with **SSH and Tailscale**, I now have a more secure and flexible workflow for experimentation and learning without being tied to my physical setup.
