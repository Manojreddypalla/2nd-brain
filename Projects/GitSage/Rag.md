| CSV/Excel | `pandas` | Convert tables to plain text or summaries |
| Images | `pytesseract`, `PIL` | OCR image content |
| Text | Native Python | Simple reading and cleaning |

### üß© What You‚Äôll Build

- A folder watcher that collects `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.pptx`, `.csv`, `.txt`
- Extracts text from each file ‚Üí converts it to clean paragraphs
- Saves a `data.json` with `{filename, filetype, content}`

‚úÖ **Outcome:** You‚Äôll have a ‚Äúuniversal file extractor‚Äù producing readable text for the RAG pipeline.

---

# üß¨ Phase 2 ‚Äî Embeddings & Vector Databases (Day 5‚Äì7)

> üéØ Goal: Learn how to convert text ‚Üí embeddings ‚Üí searchable memory.
> 

### üß† Learn These Topics

| Concept | Tool | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Embeddings** | `sentence-transformers`, OpenAI, or Hugging Face | Learn how vectors represent meaning |
| **Vector Search** | `chromadb` or `faiss` | Store and retrieve by similarity |
| **Chunking** | `tiktoken` | Split text for embedding efficiency |
| **Metadata Storage** | `sqlite3` or JSON | Track file name, page, etc. |

### üß© What You‚Äôll Build

- Create embeddings for each file‚Äôs chunks
- Store them in a local ChromaDB or FAISS
- Query with a question and get top matches

‚úÖ **Outcome:** You‚Äôll have your personal searchable memory base ‚Äî your **vectorized knowledge vault**.

---

# ü§ñ Phase 3 ‚Äî Retrieval & LLM Integration (Week 2)

> üéØ Goal: Combine your stored knowledge with an LLM to answer questions.
> 

### üß† Learn These Concepts

| Concept | Why It Matters |
| --- | --- |
| **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** | Core of your project ‚Äî retrieves and reasons |
| **Prompt Construction** | Learn to insert context correctly |
| **Context Window & Token Limit** | Avoid model cutoff |
| **LLM APIs** | OpenAI, Hugging Face, Ollama (local) |
| **Response Formatting** | Parse and clean LLM responses |

### üß© What You‚Äôll Build

- Ask: ‚ÄúWhat did my last 3 PDFs talk about?‚Äù
- System fetches relevant chunks ‚Üí sends to LLM ‚Üí returns an answer
- Add citations (filename/page) in response

‚úÖ **Outcome:** You‚Äôve built a **working RAG system** that talks about your personal data.

---

# üß† Phase 4 ‚Äî Web Interface (Week 3)

> üéØ Goal: Wrap everything into a simple app.
> 

### üß† Learn These

| Topic | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Streamlit Advanced** | Sidebar, file upload, tabs, caching |
| **Session State** | Persist search history |
| **Progress Indicators** | Visual feedback for extraction/embedding |
| **Visualization** | Graphviz / PyVis for file maps |

### üß© What You‚Äôll Build

- A Streamlit app where you:
    - Upload or link files
    - Extract & index automatically
    - Ask questions
    - View retrieved file snippets
    - Optionally show file map or relationships

‚úÖ **Outcome:** A fully usable **Local Knowledge Vault Web App**.

---

# üöÄ Phase 5 ‚Äî Scale & Optimize (Week 4+)

> üéØ Goal: Make it fast, modular, and ready for integration into your main project.
> 

### üß† Learn These

| Concept | Use |
| --- | --- |
| **Persistent Vector DB** | Save FAISS or ChromaDB to disk |
| **Incremental Indexing** | Re-index only new/changed files |
| **Summarization Layer** | Summarize long docs before embedding |
| **Multi-Modal Input** | OCR for images, audio transcription |
| **Scheduling & Automation** | Cron jobs, background processing |
| **Docker** | Package your RAG app for deployment |
| **API Layer** | FastAPI to expose your RAG engine as endpoints |

‚úÖ **Outcome:** Your system becomes a **modular, scalable AI backend** ‚Äî ready to plug into your main Git-based project.
