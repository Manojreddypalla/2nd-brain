### Projects

**Plant Disease Detection with YOLOv8** — Object Detection

Repo: [https://github.com/Manojreddypalla/Greenfield-AI](https://github.com/Manojreddypalla/Greenfield-AI)

- Trained YOLOv8 on the Roboflow PlantDoc dataset to detect multiple plant diseases.
- Achieved 0.45 mAP@[0.50:0.95] over 50 epochs; optimized data pipeline and augmentations.
- UI in progress.

**Personal Notes RAG Assistant** — Retrieval Augmented Generation

Repo: [https://github.com/Manojreddypalla/Atlas](https://github.com/Manojreddypalla/Atlas)

- Built a RAG pipeline over Obsidian markdown notes using FAISS for vector storage.
- Integrated Llama 3 via Ollama for context‑aware Q&A with chunking and reranking.

**RepoMind** — Repository Understanding with LLMs and RAG

Repo: [https://github.com/Manojreddypalla/RepoMind](https://github.com/Manojreddypalla/RepoMind)
