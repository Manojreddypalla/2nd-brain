# AI Agents Cheat Sheet

## 1. What is an AI Agent?

An AI Agent is an autonomous or semi-autonomous software system that uses Artificial Intelligence to perceive its environment, process data, make decisions, and take actions toward achieving specific goals, often without constant human intervention.

**Key Characteristics**:
*   **Autonomy**: Operates independently.
*   **Reasoning**: Makes logical decisions.
*   **Goal-oriented**: Works toward objectives.
*   **Adaptive**: Learns from interactions and improves performance over time.
*   **Tool Usage**: Leverages external resources and systems.

**How AI Agents Work**:
1.  **Perception**: Gathers and interprets data from its environment (APIs, sensors, tools, text, numbers).
2.  **Decision-Making**: Analyzes inputs using models and algorithms to decide what to do next.
3.  **Action**: Executes tasks via code, APIs, workflows, or providing recommendations.
4.  **Learning**: Adapts and optimizes based on feedback, experiences, and outcomes.

## 2. Types of AI Agents

*   **Simple Reflex Agents**: Operate solely based on the current percept.
*   **Model-Based Reflex Agents**: Maintain an internal state (a model of the environment).
*   **Goal-Based Agents**: Act to achieve specific goals.
*   **Utility-Based Agents**: Choose the action that maximizes utility.
*   **Learning Agents**: Improve performance by learning from past experiences.
*   **Proactive Agents**: Initiate actions based on goals and predictions.
*   **Reactive Agents**: Respond to specific inputs according to predefined rules.
*   **Hybrid Agents**: Combine reactive and proactive behaviors.
*   **Conversational Agents**: Communicate with humans through natural language (e.g., chatbots).
*   **Autonomous Agents**: Capable of autonomous decision-making and action.
*   **Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)**: Multiple interacting agents working together.

## 3. Core Components of AI Agents

*   **Language Model (LLM)**: The central decision-maker and reasoning engine.
*   **Tools**: Extend an AI agent's capabilities (e.g., web search, code execution, APIs).
*   **Orchestration Layer**: Governs how the agent processes information, plans, and executes actions.
*   **Memory**: Stores and recalls past experiences.
*   **Reflection**: The ability to learn from outcomes and critique its own outputs.

## 4. Core Technologies Powering Agents

*   **Large Language Models (LLMs)**
*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
*   **Reinforcement Learning**
*   **Generative AI**
*   **Multi-Modal AI**

## 5. Reasoning Patterns

*   **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**: Breaks down complex reasoning into explicit, step-by-step processes.
*   **Tree-of-Thought (ToT)**: Explores multiple reasoning pathways simultaneously.
*   **ReAct**: A framework combining reasoning and action in alternating steps.
*   **Plan-and-Execute**: Involves strategic planning first, then executing the determined sequence of actions.
*   **Self-Reflection**: The agent critiques its own outputs and learns from them.

## 6. Popular Frameworks for Building AI Agents

*   **LangChain**
*   **LlamaIndex**
*   **Microsoft AutoGen**
*   **AutoGPT**

## 7. Use Cases

*   **Personal Assistance**
*   **Business Process Automation**
*   **Research and Analysis**
*   **Customer Service**
*   **Supply Chain Management**
*   **Predictive Analytics**
