# LLM Fine-Tuning Cheat Sheet

## 1. What is LLM Fine-Tuning?

Fine-tuning adapts a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) to a specific task or domain by training it on a smaller, specialized dataset.

## 2. Why Fine-Tune?

*   **Specialization:** Adapt the model to specific jargon, style, and knowledge.
*   **Improved Performance:** Outperform general models on specific tasks.
*   **Cost-Effective:** Requires less data and computation than training from scratch.
*   **Data Privacy:** Train on proprietary data without exposing it.

## 3. When to Fine-Tune vs. Other Methods

*   **Prompt Engineering:** For basic task adaptation.
*   **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** When you need to ground responses in external documents or when information changes frequently.
*   **Fine-Tuning:** To customize tone and style, ensure data privacy, support low-resource languages, or add new capabilities.

## 4. Key Steps in Fine-Tuning

1.  **Define the Task:** (e.g., classification, summarization).
2.  **Choose a Pre-trained Model:** Select a base model suitable for your task.
3.  **Prepare Dataset:** Gather a high-quality, task-specific dataset.
4.  **Choose Fine-Tuning Method:** (e.g., full fine-tuning, PEFT).
5.  **Train:** Adjust the LLM's parameters.
6.  **Evaluate and Iterate:** Test the model and refine as needed.
7.  **Deploy:** Deploy the fine-tuned model.

## 5. Fine-Tuning Methods

*   **Full Fine-Tuning:**
    *   Updates all model parameters.
    *   **Pros:** Highest potential performance.
    *   **Cons:** Resource-intensive, risk of "catastrophic forgetting."
*   **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT):**
    *   Updates only a small subset of parameters.
    *   **Pros:** More efficient, faster, less risk of catastrophic forgetting.
    *   **Methods:**
        *   **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation):** Adds small, trainable "adapter" layers.
        *   **QLoRA (Quantized LoRA):** Quantizes model weights to a lower precision (e.g., 4-bit) to reduce memory usage further.
*   **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT):**
    *   Trains on a labeled dataset of input-output pairs.
*   **Instruction Fine-Tuning:**
    *   Trains on a dataset of instructions and desired responses.
*   **Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF):**
    *   Uses human feedback to train a "reward model" that then guides the LLM's training.

## 6. Best Practices

*   **Data Quality is Key:** High-quality data is more important than quantity.
*   **Start Small:** Begin with a smaller model and dataset to iterate quickly.
*   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Experiment with learning rate, batch size, etc.
*   **Evaluation:** Use metrics appropriate for your task.
*   **Beware of Overfitting:** Monitor training and validation loss.
