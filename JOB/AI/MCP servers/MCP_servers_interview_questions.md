# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Interview Questions

### 1. What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?
**Answer:** The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with external systems. It provides a standardized way for LLMs to discover and use tools, access external data, and perform actions. It was introduced by Anthropic.

### 2. Why is MCP important for LLMs?
**Answer:** MCP is important because it allows LLMs to overcome the limitations of their static training data and limited context windows. It enables them to access real-time information, interact with other applications, and perform complex, multi-step tasks, making them more powerful and useful.

### 3. How does MCP relate to the concept of an LLM's "context window"?
**Answer:** The context window is the LLM's internal working memory, which is limited in size. MCP provides a way to bring external information *into* the context window in a structured and efficient way. Instead of trying to fit everything into the context window at once, MCP allows the LLM to fetch the information it needs, when it needs it.

### 4. What are some examples of how MCP could be used?
**Answer:**
*   An LLM could use a tool to check the current weather for a specific location.
*   An LLM could use a tool to query a database and get information about a customer.
*   An LLM could use a tool to send an email or schedule a meeting.

### 5. What are some of the challenges associated with large context windows in LLMs?
**Answer:**
*   **Computational Cost:** The computational cost of processing the context can scale quadratically with the length of the context, making large context windows very expensive.
*   **"Lost in the Middle":** LLMs can sometimes struggle to find relevant information when the context window is very large, leading to a drop in performance.

### 6. What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and how does it relate to context management?
**Answer:** RAG is a technique where an LLM retrieves relevant information from an external knowledge base before generating a response. This is a form of context management because it allows the LLM to access a vast amount of information without having to store it all in its context window. MCP can be seen as a way to standardize the "retrieval" part of RAG.

### 7. Before MCP, how did developers typically enable LLMs to access external tools?
**Answer:** Before MCP, developers had to build custom integrations for each tool they wanted their LLM to use. This was a time-consuming and brittle process. MCP aims to solve this by providing a standardized interface for tool use.
