# RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Interview Questions

### 1. What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?
**Answer:** RAG is a technique that enhances the responses of Large Language Models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant information from an external knowledge base and providing it to the LLM as context when generating a response.

### 2. Why is RAG necessary? What problems does it solve?
**Answer:** RAG addresses several key limitations of LLMs:
*   **Knowledge Cutoff:** LLMs are not aware of information created after their training data was collected.
*   **Hallucinations:** RAG reduces the tendency of LLMs to generate incorrect or nonsensical information by grounding their responses in factual data.
*   **Lack of Specificity:** RAG allows LLMs to access domain-specific knowledge, leading to more detailed and accurate answers.
*   **Lack of Traceability:** RAG can provide source attribution, allowing users to verify the information.

### 3. What are the main components of a RAG system?
**Answer:**
*   **Knowledge Base:** The external data source.
*   **Retriever:** This component is responsible for finding relevant information in the knowledge base. It typically consists of an embedding model and a vector database.
*   **Generator:** This is the LLM that generates the final response based on the user's query and the retrieved information.

### 4. Explain the workflow of a RAG system.
**Answer:**
1.  **Indexing:** The documents in the knowledge base are split into chunks, and each chunk is converted into a numerical representation (embedding) and stored in a vector database.
2.  **Query:** The user submits a query.
3.  **Retrieval:** The user's query is embedded, and the vector database is searched for the most similar document chunks.
4.  **Augmentation:** The retrieved chunks are added to the user's query to create an "augmented prompt".
5.  **Generation:** The augmented prompt is passed to the LLM, which generates a response.

### 5. What is a vector database and why is it important for RAG?
**Answer:** A vector database is a type of database that is optimized for storing and searching vectors. It's important for RAG because it allows for efficient similarity search, which is how the retriever finds the most relevant document chunks for a given query.

### 6. How do you handle long documents in a RAG system?
**Answer:** Long documents are typically split into smaller, more manageable chunks before being indexed. This allows the retriever to find the most relevant parts of a document without having to process the entire document.

### 7. How would you evaluate the performance of a RAG system?
**Answer:**
*   **Retrieval Metrics:** Precision and recall can be used to evaluate how well the retriever is finding relevant documents.
*   **Generation Metrics:** Metrics like BLEU and ROUGE can be used to evaluate the quality of the generated text.
*   **Human Evaluation:** Ultimately, the best way to evaluate a RAG system is to have humans rate the quality of its responses.

### 8. What are some of the challenges of building and maintaining a RAG system?
**Answer:**
*   **Keeping the knowledge base up-to-date.**
*   **Ensuring the quality of the retrieved documents.**
*   **Handling ambiguous queries.**
*   **Scaling the system to handle large knowledge bases and high query volumes.**
