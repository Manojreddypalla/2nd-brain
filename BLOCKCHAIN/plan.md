- Alchemy / Infura (Node-as-a-Service)

### 🔹 Concepts:

- Smart contract deployment
- ABI & bytecode
- ERC standards (ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155)
- Events, modifiers, and inheritance
- Upgradable contracts

### 🧪 Projects:

- Deploy your first token (ERC-20)
- Build a simple NFT (ERC-721)
- Make a voting or crowdfunding DApp

⏳ **Duration:** 3–4 months (depending on your coding comfort)

---

### **🌐 PHASE 4: Web3 Integration**

**Goal:** Connect blockchain to the web.

### 🔹 Topics:

- DApps architecture (frontend + blockchain backend)
- Using **ethers.js**, **web3.js**, **Moralis**
- Connecting wallet with website (MetaMask integration)
- Decentralized storage (IPFS, Arweave)
- Node providers (Alchemy, Infura, Quicknode)

### 🧪 Projects:

- Build a web app that interacts with your smart contract
- NFT minting DApp with IPFS metadata

⏳ **Duration:** 2–3 months

---

### **🔐 PHASE 5: Blockchain Security & Ethical Hacking**

**Goal:** Understand vulnerabilities and security best practices.

### 🔹 Topics:

- Smart contract bugs (reentrancy, overflow, underflow)
- Static & dynamic analysis tools:
    - Slither, MythX, Echidna, Manticore
- Fuzz testing
- Randomness & Oracle attacks
- Auditing process
- Gas optimization

### 🧪 Practice:

- Use test contracts to find vulnerabilities
- Try auditing your own DApp
- Learn from real-world exploits (The DAO, Poly Network, etc.)

⏳ **Duration:** 2–3 months

---

### **⚡ PHASE 6: Advanced Blockchain Systems**

**Goal:** Dive into next-gen technologies and scalability.

### 🔹 Topics:

- Consensus beyond PoW/PoS (DPoS, PBFT)
- Layer 2 scaling (Rollups, zk-SNARKs, Plasma)
- Cross-chain bridges
- Interoperability (Cosmos, Polkadot)
- Decentralized Identity (DID)
- DeFi protocols (Aave, Uniswap, Compound)
- DAOs (governance, voting models)
- Privacy blockchains (Zcash, Monero)

### 🔢 Math:

- Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZK-SNARKs basics)
- Elliptic curve pairings (for advanced crypto)
- Byzantine Fault Tolerance models

⏳ **Duration:** 4–6+ months (deep and research-level)

---

### **🏗️ PHASE 7: Professional & Ecosystem**

**Goal:** Work like a blockchain developer or researcher.

### 🔹 Topics:

- Version control (Git/GitHub)
- Testing & deployment
- Monitoring & upgrading contracts
- Building for scale
- Participate in hackathons, open-source projects
- Follow ecosystems:
    - Ethereum / Polygon / Solana / Avalanche / BSC

### 🧪 Portfolio:

- Build 3–5 projects:
    1. Simple token
    2. NFT marketplace
    3. DeFi clone (like Uniswap)
