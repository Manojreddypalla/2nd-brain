Yes, it’s definitely possible to host **Obsidian notes as a website**, but it requires some steps because Obsidian itself is just a local Markdown editor—it doesn’t serve web pages directly. Here’s a clear breakdown:

---

### **1. Convert your notes to a website**

You have a few popular ways:

### **a) Obsidian Publish (Official)**

- Paid service by Obsidian.
- One-click publishing of your vault as a website.
- Pros: Super easy, keeps your Obsidian links, supports search.
- Cons: Paid.

### **b) Using Static Site Generators**

- You can convert Markdown to a website yourself:
    
    **Popular options:**
    
    1. **Obsidian to Hugo** (or Jekyll / Eleventy)
        - Export or sync your notes as Markdown.
        - Use a static site generator to turn them into a website.
    2. **Obsidian to Docsify / MkDocs / Docusaurus**
        - These are simpler for docs/blogs.
        - You just point them to your Markdown folder.
        - They auto-generate a navigable website.

### **c) Using Obsidian Plugins**

- **Obsidian Git**: Sync your vault to GitHub.
- Use GitHub Pages to serve it as a website.
- Combine with **Obsidian-to-MkDocs** or **Obsidian-to-VitePress** for styling.

### **2. Hosting options**

- **Free**: GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel.
- **Paid**: Any cloud hosting (AWS, DigitalOcean) if you want a custom domain.

### **3. Example workflow (free)**

1. Install **Obsidian Git** plugin → push vault to GitHub.
2. Set up **MkDocs** (or Docsify) locally → point to your notes folder.
3. Generate the static site (`mkdocs build`).
4. Push the generated site to GitHub Pages → your notes are now a web site.

✅ **Quick tip:** If you want something **instant and free**, use **Obsidian Publish trial** or **GitHub Pages + MkDocs**.
