### 🧠 **Phase 1 — Breadth (2–3 weeks)**

Goal: Understand the **landscape** of AI agents and their purpose.

✅ Explore at a surface level:

- smolagents → lightweight concept
- LangChain → modular LLM toolkit
- LangGraph → graph-based workflows
- AutoGen → conversational multi-agents
- CrewAI → structured team-like agents
- LlamaIndex → data connectors for RAG
- VLMs → image + text reasoning
- Web Agents → browser + internet interaction

🎯 Output: You’ll understand what’s possible, how frameworks differ, and which excites you most.

---

### 🧱 **Phase 2 — Depth (4–6 weeks per framework)**

Goal: Pick **one path** (like LangChain + LangGraph) and go deep.

Go through:

- Docs + real tutorials
- Recreate example projects
- Then build your *own* mini system (your unique idea)

🎯 Output: You’ll know the internals — prompt management, memory handling, error correction, tool usage, etc.
