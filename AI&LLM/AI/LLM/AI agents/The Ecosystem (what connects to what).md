# The Ecosystem (what connects to what)

## 

| Level | Framework | Role / What It Does | Learn When |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 🧩 1 | **smolagents** | Simple, lightweight multi-agent system (Hugging Face). Best to learn the *concept* of agents + tools. | ✅ You already started |
| 🧠 2 | **LangChain** | A full toolkit for building LLM apps: memory, chains, tools, RAG, agents. | 🔜 Learn next |
| 🔄 3 | **LangGraph** | A *controller* built on top of LangChain — lets you design loops, branches, multi-agent graphs. | After LangChain basics |
| 🧰 4 | **LlamaIndex** | Handles your custom data for retrieval (RAG). Often works *with* LangChain or LangGraph. | Optional, after LangChain |
| 👀 5 | **VLMs (Vision-Language Models)** | Models that can see and reason over images + text (e.g. LLaVA, Gemini, GPT-4V). | Anytime — if you like vision tasks |
| 🌐 6 | **Web/Browser Agents** | Agents that interact with real websites or data (via APIs or headless browsers). | After agent foundations |
