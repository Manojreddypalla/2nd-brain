## 🧠 Big Picture: What You Can Build with `smolagents`

smolagents lets you create **autonomous or semi-autonomous agents** with specialized skills:

| Category | What It Does | Example Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🧩 **Text Agents (LLM-only)** | Pure reasoning, planning, answering, summarizing | “Write a report about renewable energy” |
| 🖼️ **Vision Agents (VLM)** | Understand images + text (multimodal) | Identify faces, read documents, describe photos |
| 🌐 **Web / Browser Agents** | Control the web: search, click, extract info, take screenshots | Automatically verify product listings, scrape and summarize websites |
| 💻 **Code Agents** | Write and execute code during reasoning | Solve math, run Python, create plots, analyze data |
| 🧰 **Tool-Using Agents** | Call APIs or Python functions as tools | Control a database, send an email, use a calculator |
| 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Multi-Agent Systems** | Combine specialized agents to cooperate | A manager agent delegates tasks to worker agents (e.g. coder + researcher + visual checker) |

## ⚙️ 1. **LLM Agent (Language Model Core)**

Every smolagent starts with a **core model**, e.g. `OpenAIServerModel("gpt-4o")` or `HuggingFaceLocalModel()`.

This gives your agent the **brain** — reasoning, planning, and communication.

**You can plug any model backend:**

- 🧠 GPT models (`gpt-4o`, `gpt-4-turbo`, etc.)
- 🤗 Hugging Face models (like Mistral, Llama 3)
- 🔌 Local models (via Ollama or API)

---

## 👁️ 2. **VLM (Vision-Language Models)**

These let your agent **see and interpret images**.

### What You Can Do:

✅ Describe, classify, or compare images

✅ Extract visual text (OCR-like)

✅ Analyze charts, UI screenshots, or scanned docs

✅ Detect anomalies or objects

✅ Compare two photos (e.g. “Are these people the same?”)

### Example:

- Verify an ID card photo vs live camera image
- Understand a product image and match with a catalog
- Read a document and summarize its content

**Models you can use:**

`gpt-4o`, `claude-3.5-sonnet`, `llava`, `blip-3`, `idefics2`, etc.

---

## 🌐 3. **Web / Browser Agents**

This lets your agent **browse the real web** and extract live information.

### What You Can Do:

✅ Search the web (DuckDuckGoSearchTool)

✅ Navigate sites using Selenium/Helium

✅ Take screenshots, read pages, close popups

✅ Gather information automatically and summarize it

### Example Use Cases:

- Verify the truth of a claim (fact-checking)
- Scrape live data (like stock prices or event details)
- Visually check a webpage layout
- Automatically fill a form or perform a task online

**Framework features:**

- `DuckDuckGoSearchTool` (search)
- `Helium/Selenium` (browsing & clicking)
- `save_screenshot()` (for visual agents)

---

## 💻 4. **Code Agents (Self-coding AI)**

This is where the agent writes and runs **Python code** in a sandbox.

### What You Can Do:

✅ Execute code to solve logic or data tasks

✅ Run numerical simulations

✅ Plot graphs, parse data, run ML models

✅ Generate and debug code autonomously

### Example:

- “Read this CSV and calculate the average sales.”
- “Plot the revenue growth from this dataset.”
- “Generate Python code to find Fibonacci numbers.”

**In smolagents:**

```python
from smolagents import CodeAgent
agent = CodeAgent(model=model)

```

This agent can **generate, execute, and reason** about Python code dynamically.

---

## 🧰 5. **Tool-Using Agents**

smolagents allows you to define **custom tools** — basically Python functions that the agent can call when needed.

### What You Can Do:

✅ Give the agent special powers beyond text or code

✅ Define APIs as callable functions

✅ Add database queries, IoT control, etc.

### Example:

```python
def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    # call weather API here
    return f"The weather in {city} is 28°C."

agent = CodeAgent(
    model=model,
    tools=[get_weather],
)

```

Then you can ask:

> “What’s the weather in Hyderabad?”
> 
> 
> → The agent automatically calls `get_weather()`!
>

## 🤖 6. **Multi-Agent Systems**

You can **combine multiple agents**, each with a specialization, into a team.

### Example Setup:

- **Researcher Agent**: searches web + collects data
- **Coder Agent**: writes and executes Python code
- **Vision Agent**: checks images
- **Manager Agent**: plans tasks and delegates to others

This mirrors what frameworks like **LangGraph** and **CrewAI** do — smolagents can interoperate with them too.

### Example Task:

> “Collect images of electric cars, analyze their designs, and summarize the most common features.”
> 
- Researcher → Searches and downloads images
- Vision Agent → Describes designs
- Coder Agent → Summarizes patterns
- Manager → Compiles final report

---

## 📦 7. **Data Agents (structured data + reasoning)**

Agents that work with **structured data** — like CSVs, JSON, or SQL.

They can:

✅ Parse and understand tables

✅ Execute SQL queries

✅ Summarize datasets

---

## 🔐 8. **APIs + External Systems**

You can give agents access to:

- Hugging Face models (via `HuggingFaceTool`)
- Web APIs (REST)
- Local scripts or files

So they can combine reasoning with data from **any external source**.
