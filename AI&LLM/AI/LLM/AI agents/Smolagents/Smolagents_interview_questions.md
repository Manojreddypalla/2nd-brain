# Smolagents Interview Questions

### 1. What is Smolagents and its primary purpose?
**Answer:** Smolagents is a Python library from Hugging Face that simplifies creating AI agents. Its main goal is to enable language models to interact with the real world and perform complex tasks.

### 2. What are the key advantages of Smolagents?
**Answer:**
*   **Code Agents:** Agents write and execute Python code for high flexibility.
*   **Hugging Face Integration:** Seamless access to models and tools on the Hugging Face Hub.
*   **Easy Tool Creation:** Simple to define custom tools.
*   **Memory Management:** Supports memory for context-aware decisions.
*   **Security:** Features for secure code execution, including sandboxing and authorized imports.

### 3. Explain the difference between `CodeAgent` and `ToolCallingAgent`.
**Answer:**
*   **`CodeAgent`:** Generates tool calls as executable Python code. It's highly expressive but carries a higher risk of errors and requires a secure environment.
*   **`ToolCallingAgent`:** Generates tool calls as structured JSON. It's more reliable and safer but less expressive.

### 4. How do you define and optimize custom tools in Smolagents?
**Answer:** Custom tools are typically Python functions with specific attributes: `name`, `description`, `input types`, and `output type`. To optimize them, use informative names, type hints, and clear docstrings.

### 5. When would you use Smolagents?
**Answer:** It's ideal for rapid prototyping, automating complex tasks, and when an LLM needs to dynamically determine the workflow. For simple, fixed workflows, direct coding might be more efficient.

### 6. How does Smolagents address security with `CodeAgent`?
**Answer:** Smolagents allows code execution in a secure sandbox. It limits the functions an agent can call to explicitly provided tools and a set of safe functions. The `authorized_imports` argument lets developers permit specific libraries, enhancing security.
