# ReAct

## 🧩 1. What is the ReAct Framework?

**ReAct = Reason + Act**

It’s a framework that lets an AI model do two things *together*:

- **Reason:** Think step-by-step about the problem (internally or explicitly)
- **Act:** Interact with the outside world (run code, call APIs, search web, etc.)

So instead of *just generating text*, the model now has a **loop**:

```
→ Think → Decide → Act → Observe → Think again → ...

```

This loop continues until the task is solved.

## ⚙️ 2. Core Idea of a Code Agent

A **Code Agent** is a special kind of ReAct agent focused on **programming and tool use**.

It doesn’t just reason — it can:

- Write and run code (Python, JS, etc.)
- Use tools (like a web browser, file system, or database)
- Analyze results
- Refine its next actions

### 🔁 The basic loop:

1. **User input:**
    
    “Write a Python script to calculate prime numbers up to 100.”
    
2. **Agent reasoning:**
    
    “I should write a Python function using a for loop and check divisibility.”
    
3. **Agent action:**
    
    It writes and runs the Python code.
    
4. **Observation:**
    
    The output comes back — e.g., `[2, 3, 5, 7, ...]`.
    
5. **Reason again:**
    
    “The output is correct. I’ll return it to the user.”

## 🧠 3. The Internal ReAct Cycle (Detailed)

Let’s visualize the cycle:

```
User Input → [Thought] → [Action] → [Observation] → [Thought] → [Action] → ... → [Final Answer]

```

Each part:

| Step | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Thought** | Model reasons internally | “I should write code to get data from API.” |
| **Action** | Model uses a tool (runs code, queries API) | `requests.get("https://api.weather.com/...")` |
| **Observation** | Model gets the result | `{ "temp": 28 }` |
| **Next Thought** | Uses result to plan next step | “Temperature is 28°C, now I’ll summarize.” |
| **Answer** | Returns final output to user | “The temperature is 28°C.” |

## 🧰 4. How It Works in Code (Simplified Pseudocode)

Here’s a simplified structure (like what LangChain / OpenDevin uses):

```python
while not done:
    # Step 1: Model reasons
    thought = llm.generate_thought(memory, user_input)

    # Step 2: Model decides an action
    action = llm.decide_action(thought)

    # Step 3: Execute action
    result = tools[action.tool_name](action.arguments)

    # Step 4: Feed observation back to model
    memory.append({"thought": thought, "action": action, "observation": result})

    # Step 5: Check if finished
    done = llm.is_done(result)

```

So the AI literally “thinks → acts → learns → repeats.”

## 🧩 5. Real Example (Code Agent ReAct)

**Prompt:**

> “Find the average of numbers from 1 to 10 using Python.”
> 

**Agent reasoning loop:**

```
Thought: I need to write Python code to calculate the average.
Action: run_python("sum(range(1,11))/10")
Observation: 5.5
Thought: The output is correct.
Final Answer: The average is 5.5.

```

## ⚡ 6. How It Differs from a Normal LLM

| Normal LLM | ReAct / Code Agent |
| --- | --- |
| Just predicts text | Thinks + Acts iteratively |
| Static | Dynamic (can run code, fetch data) |
| Often hallucinates | Can verify via tools |
| Single output | Multi-step loop with feedback |

---

## 🧠 7. Example Tools Used by Code Agents

A code agent can use different tools (each one is an **“Action”** in ReAct):

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| 🧮 Python Tool | Run code for calculations |
| 🌐 Web Search Tool | Get fresh data |
| 📁 File Tool | Read/write files |
| 🧰 Shell Tool | Run system commands |
| 🧑‍💻 API Tool | Access structured APIs |

---

## 🧭 8. Real-World Implementations

| Framework | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **LangChain ReAct Agent** | Uses LLM + Tools + Memory |
| **OpenDevin** | Code execution ReAct agent (open-source) |
| **AutoGPT / BabyAGI** | Extended ReAct loops with long-term goals |
| **ChatGPT Code Interpreter** | Simplified ReAct loop with a Python sandbox |

---

## 🧩 9. Summary (How a Code Agent Works)

| Phase | What Happens |
| --- | --- |
| **Reasoning** | LLM plans next step |
| **Action** | Executes code or tool |
| **Observation** | Reads the result |
| **Reflection** | Decides next move |
| **Termination** | Returns final answer |

✅ In short:

> A Code Agent is an AI that uses the ReAct loop to think, execute, and self-correct until it produces a reliable result.
