# About

Got it 👍 here’s n8n in short:

- **n8n** = workflow automation tool (like Zapier/Make, but open to self-hosting).
- Lets you connect apps, APIs, and databases with a **visual editor**.
- Has **trigger nodes** (start workflow) + **action nodes** (do tasks).
- Supports **no-code + custom code** for flexibility.
- Can be **self-hosted** (privacy, control) or used via n8n Cloud.
- Used for: syncing data, automating reports, integrating AI, notifications, approvals, etc.
- Strength: flexibility, integrations, community.
- Weakness: setup/hosting complexity, scaling challenges, license not fully open-source.

👉 In simple terms: **n8n helps you automate “when X happens, do Y and Z” across different apps/systems.**
