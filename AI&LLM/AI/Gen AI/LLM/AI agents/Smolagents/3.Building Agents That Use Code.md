# Building Agents That Use Code

## **Code Agents — smolagents Overview**

### 🔹 What are Code Agents?

- **Default agent type** in `smolagents`.
- They **generate and execute Python code** to perform actions.
- Designed to be **lightweight**, ~1,000 lines of code.
- Use **code snippets** instead of JSON for tool calls → more efficient and expressive.

## ⚡ **Why Code Agents?**

### 🔸 Traditional (JSON-based) Agents

- Specify actions in JSON (tool name + args as strings).
- System must parse and interpret them before execution.
- Limited expressiveness and composability.

### 🔸 Code Agents (Python-based)

Writing actions as Python code has major advantages:

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 🧩 **Composability** | Combine and reuse code easily. |
| 📦 **Object Management** | Work directly with complex structures (e.g., images, lists). |
| 🌍 **Generality** | Can express any computational task. |
| 🧠 **Natural for LLMs** | LLMs are trained heavily on code → they handle Python generation better. |
