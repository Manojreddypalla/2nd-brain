# types of agents

### **2️⃣ CodeAgents**

`CodeAgents` are the primary type of agent in `smolagents`. Instead of generating JSON or text, these agents produce Python code to perform actions. This module explores their purpose, functionality, and how they work, along with hands-on examples to showcase their capabilities.

### **3️⃣ ToolCallingAgents**

`ToolCallingAgents` are the second type of agent supported by `smolagents`. Unlike `CodeAgents`, which generate Python code, these agents rely on JSON/text blobs that the system must parse and interpret to execute actions. This module covers their functionality, their key differences from `CodeAgents`, and it provides an example to illustrate their usage.

### **4️⃣ Tools**

As we saw in Unit 1, tools are functions that an LLM can use within an agentic system, and they act as the essential building blocks for agent behavior. This module covers how to create tools, their structure, and different implementation methods using the `Tool` class or the `@tool` decorator. You’ll also learn about the default toolbox, how to share tools with the community, and how to load community-contributed tools for use in your agents.

### **5️⃣ Retrieval Agents**

Retrieval agents allow models access to knowledge bases, making it possible to search, synthesize, and retrieve information from multiple sources. They leverage vector stores for efficient retrieval and implement **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** patterns. These agents are particularly useful for integrating web search with custom knowledge bases while maintaining conversation context through memory systems. This module explores implementation strategies, including fallback mechanisms for robust information retrieval.

### **6️⃣ Multi-Agent Systems**

Orchestrating multiple agents effectively is crucial for building powerful, multi-agent systems. By combining agents with different capabilities—such as a web search agent with a code execution agent—you can create more sophisticated solutions. This module focuses on designing, implementing, and managing multi-agent systems to maximize efficiency and reliability.

### **7️⃣ Vision and Browser agents**

Vision agents extend traditional agent capabilities by incorporating **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)**, enabling them to process and interpret visual information. This module explores how to design and integrate VLM-powered agents, unlocking advanced functionalities like image-based reasoning, visual data analysis, and multimodal interactions. We will also use vision agents to build a browser agent that can browse the web and extract information from it.
