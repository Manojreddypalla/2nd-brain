### What is Kubernetes?

**Kubernetes** (often called **K8s**) is a free, open-source tool that helps you **run and manage many containers** (like Docker containers) easily — especially when your app runs on many computers or servers.

### ⚙️ Key Features (in simple words):

1. **Architecture:**
    
    Kubernetes has different parts (like API server, kubelet, etc.) that work together to manage and monitor containers automatically.
    
2. **Scalability:**
    
    It can **increase or decrease** the number of running containers based on how busy your app is — automatically.
    
3. **Flexibility:**
    
    You can **customize** almost everything in Kubernetes, making it suitable for any kind of project.
    
4. **Portability:**
    
    Kubernetes can run **anywhere** — on cloud (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) or on your own servers.
    
5. **Community:**
    
    It has a **large global community** that constantly improves Kubernetes and helps others use it.
