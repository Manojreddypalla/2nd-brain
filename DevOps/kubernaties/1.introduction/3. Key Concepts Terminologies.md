### **1. Cluster Architecture**

👉 The **structure** of a Kubernetes system — how its parts work together.

A **Kubernetes Cluster** has two main parts:

- **Control Plane (Brain)** — makes decisions about what should happen.
    - Components:
        - **API Server:** Entry point for all commands (like `kubectl`).
        - **Scheduler:** Decides which node runs a pod.
        - **Controller Manager:** Keeps the system’s state correct.
        - **etcd:** Database that stores cluster info.
- **Nodes (Workers)** — actually run your containers.
    - Components:
        - **Kubelet:** Communicates with the control plane and runs pods.
        - **Container runtime:** Like Docker or containerd.
        - **Kube-proxy:** Manages network routing.

🧠 Example:

Imagine a factory (cluster). The **manager** (control plane) assigns tasks to **workers** (nodes), who do the actual work.

---

### **2. Containers**

👉 Containers are **lightweight packages** that include your app + all dependencies (like Python, Node.js, libraries).

🧠 Example:

A container is like a **lunchbox** — everything your app needs to “run” is packed inside.

- Kubernetes doesn’t run apps directly — it runs **containers** (often created using **Docker**).

---

### **3. Workloads**

👉 Workloads define **what to run** and **how to run it** in Kubernetes.

The smallest unit:

- **Pod:** One or more containers that share the same network and storage.
    
    Example: A web app + a logging helper container.
    

Higher-level abstractions built on Pods:

- **Deployment:** Automatically manages multiple replicas (copies) of pods.
- **ReplicaSet:** Ensures the desired number of pods are running.
- **DaemonSet:** Ensures one pod per node (like monitoring agents).
- **StatefulSet:** For apps that need stable storage (like databases).
- **Job/CronJob:** For tasks that run once or on schedule.

🧠 Example:

A **Deployment** is like your app’s “manager,” ensuring the right number of workers (pods) are always running.

---

### **4. Services, Load Balancing, and Networking**

👉 Kubernetes provides ways for pods to talk to each other and to the outside world.

- **Service:** Gives a fixed IP or DNS name to a set of pods.
- **ClusterIP:** Internal-only access.
- **NodePort:** Exposes app on each node’s IP at a static port.
- **LoadBalancer:** Connects to external load balancers (like AWS, GCP).
- **Ingress:** Manages HTTP/HTTPS routing using domain names.

🧠 Example:

Pods can come and go, so a **Service** is like a phone number that always connects to the right person, even if they move offices.

---

### **5. Storage**

👉 Containers are temporary — data is lost when they restart.

Kubernetes provides ways to keep or share data:

- **Volumes:** Storage attached to a pod.
- **PersistentVolume (PV):** A piece of storage in the cluster.
- **PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC):** A request for storage by a pod.
- **StorageClass:** Defines types of storage (SSD, HDD, etc).

🧠 Example:

Think of **PV** as a storage room and **PVC** as a key that requests access to that room.

---

### **6. Configuration**

👉 Manage **settings and secrets** separately from your app code.

- **ConfigMap:** Stores non-sensitive data (like environment variables).
- **Secret:** Stores sensitive data (like passwords, API keys).

🧠 Example:

Instead of hardcoding passwords in your app, you store them securely in a **Secret**, and the pod can read them when needed.

---

### **7. Cluster Administration**

👉 This is about **setting up and managing** the entire Kubernetes cluster.

Includes:

- Adding/removing nodes.
- Managing access control (RBAC).
- Upgrading clusters.
- Monitoring and logging.
- Managing namespaces and resource quotas.

🧠 Example:

Cluster administration = being the **system admin** of the whole factory (cluster).
